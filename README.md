Install
-------

aioitertools requires Python 3.8 or newer.
You can install it from PyPI:

    $ pip install aioitertools


Usage
-----

aioitertools shadows the standard library whenever possible to provide
asynchronous version of the modules and functions you already know.  It's
fully compatible with standard iterators and async iterators alike, giving
you one unified,Â familiar interface for interacting with iterable objects:

```python
from aioitertools import iter, next, map, zip

something = iter(...)
first_item = await next(something)

async for item in iter(something):
    ...


async def fetch(url):
    response = await aiohttp.request(...)
    return response.json

async for value in map(fetch, MANY_URLS):
    ...


async for a, b in zip(something, something_else):
    ...
```


aioitertools emulates the entire `itertools` module, offering the same
function signatures, but as async generators.  All functions support
standard iterables and async iterables alike, and can take functions or
coroutines:

```python
from aioitertools import chain, islice

async def generator1(...):
    yield ...

async def generator2(...):
    yield ...

async for value in chain(generator1(), generator2()):
    ...

async for value in islice(generator1(), 2, None, 2):
    ...
```

documentation of functions and abilities.
